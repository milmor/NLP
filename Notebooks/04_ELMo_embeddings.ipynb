      "b\"This was an absolutely terrible movie. Don't be lured in by Christopher Walken or Michael Ironside. Both are great actors, but this must simply be their worst role in history. Even their great acting could not redeem this movie's ridiculous storyline. This movie is an early nineties US propaganda piece. The most pathetic scenes were those when the Columbian rebels were making their cases for revolutions. Maria Conchita Alonso appeared phony, and her pseudo-love affair with Walken was nothing but a pathetic emotional plug in a movie that was devoid of any real meaning. I am disappointed that there are movies like this, ruining actor's like Christopher Walken's good name. I could barely sit through it.\" 0\n"

      "       b'it\\'s nothing more than a weird coincidence that i decided to watch starlift on the 59th anniversary of the day in june 1950 when president truman\\'s ordered us forces into the korean war. starlift, you see, is set largely at travis air force base in california in the years when it was being used as a staging post for soldiers being shipped out to fight in korea. but you\\'d need to do your own research to know this because not once during the film is the name \\'korea\\' mentioned. we see transport aircraft flying out fresh troops and returning with wounded soldiers but there\\'s no mention of where these men will be fighting or getting injured. which is kind of weird for a film designed to wave the flag and salute america\\'s men in uniform. released in december 1951 by warner brothers, starlift is a very obvious effort to replicate the success of the studio\\'s star-studded world war two home-front morale booster \"hollywood canteen.\" this 1944 crowd-pleaser told the story of two soldiers spending their last three nights of leave hanging out at the famous armed forces nightclub in la hoping to get a date with joan leslie. but really it was just an excuse for warners to trot out every star under contract, from joan crawford, john garfield, and barbara stanwyck to peter lorre, bette davis, sydney greenstreet and more. starlift features two air force soldiers hoping to meet fictional starlet nell wayne (a mask-like janice rule) and persuading a bunch of warner bros stars to put on a show for the departing troops. but in place of crawford, garfield et al the best the brothers warner could scrape up in 1951 were doris day, ruth roman, gordon macrae, virginia mayo, gene nelson and phil harris with fleeting appearances by james cagney, randolph scott, and a clearly embarrassed looking gary cooper. this threadbare cast, whose combined star power would struggle to illuminate a standard lamp, is perfectly matched by the crummy production values. presumably in an effort to save money several long scenes were shot using really really bad back projection. how bad is it? you can see the join where the screen meets the floor of the soundstage! to describe starlift as a sloppy, lazy and third rate movie is to do a disservice to films which are sloppy, lazy and third rate. it\\'s just terrible. avoid it.',\n",
      "       b'since their nasty divorce from the disney company (with disney keeping the miramax brand) the weinstein company seems to specialize in above average movies which are then under-promoted and seen by few. the flock is a prime example.  a story about the civil servants who have the nasty job of keeping track of registered sex offenders, this picture will tell you more about sex criminals than an entire season of law and order - svu.  richard gere gives his best-ever performance as the soft-spoken agent worn-out by the task. claire danes for once has the opportunity to get into a solid role (instead of the junk she normally gets stuck in) and she makes the most of playing the novice. the cinematography, pacing, editing, all of it is first rate --- and i saw no trace of the attention-deficit-disorder camera jump-around or excess camera cuts that others complained about. the subject is handled with restraint, but it\\'s still a tough subject and might make you sick.  fifty years ago there was almost no problem with the kinds of sex crimes herein shown in abundance which will shock even the jaded. then came the supreme court decisions which simultaneously tied police hands as the \"rights\" of sex perverts were opened up and america was turned into a shopper\\'s paradise for sexual perversity, both willing and unwilling. each such step was met with praise by liberals, who celebrated the warren court\\'s ill deeds with glossy covers on time and newsweek. everyday liberals also praised the court\\'s action and mocked those who disagree. in 2007 how many americans know that the kind of pornography that depicts savage violence and torture of young women -- can be subscribed to, and delivery of it is subsidized by the discount periodicals rate by the us post office. just one part of the problem -- a problem that can tare anyone\\'s family to shreds.  richard gere is a liberal, but he gives his best in his performance here. perhaps in his maturing age he\\'s gained a measure of wisdom.',\n",

      "       b\"i'm not sure why this little film has been banished into obscurity, as despite some rather silly goings on; the sentinel is a clever and inventive horror film that gives most of the highly praised ghost stories of today more than a run for their money. michael winner has admitted many times that he's not the best director of all time, and that does shine through on a number of occasions with this film; but it has to be said that the film works in spite of it's uninspired direction, and the fact that winner has somehow managed to round up a simply amazing cast of talent more than makes up for it. the plot is rich with mystery, and begins by focusing on alison parker and her hunt for a flat. she finds that she can't afford most properties she looks at, but thinks her luck has changed when she finds a fully furnished apartment for an affordable price. her problems start soon after moving in, as she doesn't like her neighbours very much...and this problem increases when the property broker tells her that she has just one neighbour; an elderly blind priest on the top floor...  the cast list is truly superb, with the relatively unknown cristina raines heading up a great support cast. chris sarandon is a little wooden in his role opposite raines, but small parts for the likes of john carradine, eli wallach, ava gardner, jeff goldblum and christopher walken, to name but a handful more than make up for sarandon's lifeless portrayal. michael winner does a good job with his central location, as the block of flats provides a creepy and macabre setting for the story. the film is a little slow to start, but it's never boring; and michael winner's screenplay provides a surprise that's almost impossible to guess from the offset, which certainly deserves some praise. like many similar slow-burning horrors, this one doesn't go for the money shot early on - but unlike many, the ending is a definite climax as winner goes all out to shock the viewer, and if the rumour that he used actual human oddities is true; i've got to say that he does a very good job at it! overall, while this film may be pure hokum whichever way you look at it; the sentinel is one of the better films of its type, and it's definitely a major highlight for its director.\",\n",

      "       b\"i could write a big enough comment on any one of the characters in gundam wing, they could each lead the series with their internal conflicts. instead we get 8 great leads that take us through 49 golden episodes of anime bliss.  it contains dialogue that you can roll around in your head for months... years, and then go back to and derive new meaning from, a masterpiece in script writing (even though it has the typical anime trait of there being a disparity between subtitles and english dub). it has an abundance of concepts and philosophies that make you think about your own views.  the relationships between the cold unfeeling males and loving female characters is a stand alone aspect of this series. the relationship between heero and relena, and milliardo and noin are joys to watch. the apparent rejection of the male is underpinned with an inner turmoil that makes the love (a word never mentioned in the series) of the women necessary for them in their harsh soldier environment. the women are chasing aspects of the men that we rarely, if at all see, which makes the leading men all the more enigmatic. it takes heero all of the 49 episodes to show some caring, but he gets there, and when he does, its a big pay off.   and then there's the giant robot fighting. fun to watch awesome sequences as good as any hollywood epic fight scene. any less clued up person would see giant robot fighting as a silly cartoon function for kids, as has become clear when i'm trying to recommend this series to my friends, but they're wrong. many of the giant robot fights in gundam wing contain a hefty dose of pathos, usually concerning young rebels fighting for what they believe in against an oppressive society making their beliefs obsolete.  the constant shifts in tone and emphasis through each episode makes gundam wing impossible to be boring, it is a captivating, thought provoking study on the potential of the human mind and body.\",\n",

      "       b\"2 stars for kay francis -- she's wonderful! and she didn't deserve this horrible tripe that warner bros. threw her way!   the two-pronged premise that this movie is based on is ridiculous and unbelievable in the extreme. kay is a small-town wife and mother who yearns for something bigger: she wants to be an actress. when a big-shot actor comes to town and invites kay to his hotel to talk about possibilities, kay tells her husband she's going to the movies. the hubby's biddy of a mother puts a bug in hubby's ear that kay's not being truthful, and he sets out looking for her. he finds her w/ the actor in the hotel (they are only talking!) and he slugs the guy, who falls over a railing, lands face-first in a pond (lake?), and dies. now here's the two unbelievable premises upon which the rest of the movie is based:   1) the judge tells the jury that if it's determined that the man died *before* his head went into the water, that they must find the hubby guilty of first degree murder. (whaaaaa?????? i think slugging a guy in a fit of rage would count for manslaughter or murder 2 at the most, not first degree murder. give me a break! but the plot required him being found guilty of murder 1 so that he could be sent to prison for life. whatever.)   2) the hubby's lawyer, after the conviction and sentencing, tells kay that it's all her fault. his reasoning is that if she hadn't gone over to the actor's room, then her husband wouldn't have had to go after her and slug the guy and kill him. he tells her that she's the guilty one, not her husband, and she nods and agrees. what. the. hell?!?!?! the rest of the movie is all about kay trying to achieve fame and money in order to get her husband released from prison and right the wrong she committed by causing him to kill the actor dude in the first place.  i can't even go on with this review. the movie was just all too painful. four years earlier, in the pre-code days, you'd never have caught kay playing such a wimp! in true kay francis fashion, though, she did do her best to make us believe that this woman was a believable character. i give her much credit for trying to breathe some life and credibility to this thankless role. this character was a far cry from pre-code kay roles and real-life spitfire kay francis.  steer way clear of this one! there are much better kay francis vehicles out there! (from personal experience, i can highly recommend mary stevens, md and jewel robbery; also good are dr. monica and one way passage. i'm sure there's other great kay flicks as well, but i'm only mentioning the ones i've seen and can recommend.)\",\n",
      "       b\"i have seen the movie holes and say that it has to be the best movie all year long. it brings out the child in everyone. i mean who would come up with the idea of having troublesome boys dig holes as their punishment? louis sachar thats who. although the movie was different from the book it was still very good. for example caveman/stanley was supposed to be the biggest one there. weight wise and height wise but zigzag/ricky was taller and armpit/theodore was bigger. also x-ray/rex was supposed to be one of the smallest boys but wasn't. the only thing that i didn't like about the movie was that the flashbacks were rather persuasive and long. i would have rather seen more of the present than past but thats just my opinion. i especially like the work of the boys though. like squid/alan who was played by jake m.smith was supposed to be a moody and tough kid. jake m.smith performed just that and did a great job at it as did almost all of the actors in holes. so i would say if you havent seen holes yet then you should definatly see it when it comes out again or you'll be missing out on a whole lotta fun.\",\n",
